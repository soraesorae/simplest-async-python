# simplest-async-python
- This is a toy project to understanding asynchronous operations
- I referred to a lot of python [asyncio](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/6abddd9f6afdddc09031989e0deb25e301ecf315/Lib/asyncio) and [selectors](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/6abddd9f6afdddc09031989e0deb25e301ecf315/Lib/selectors.py) code. As a result, my code is similar to asyncio and selectors code.
## Usage
```shell
python3 example.py <addr> <port>
```
